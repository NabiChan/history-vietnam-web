                        <h2>The art of war in Vietnam history</h2>
                        <p>
                            Throughout of the entire history of Vietnam, they have defeated many strong Empires and country from Mongolia Empire, China to France and United State. To won againts those invaders, tactics play a very important role in the war so lets summarize all the tactics history of this country. One of the most useful tactics in dynastic period in Vietnam was putting stakes under the river and lurring them to the river wait the water to fall down and destroy enemies naval and one of the significant battle using this was battle of Bạch Đằng river in 1228 made thousands of Yuan armies dead or captured<br>
                            <br>
                            Another tactics was Empty garden, when army destroy food and properties and move the citizen away so that when the enemies came they didnt have any food and supply from the destroyed place and this was used in 1258 againts Mongol Empire made the enemies suffered from food shortage and play an important role to win the battle. And the most used tactic strategy in vietnam was guerilla, when facing much more stronger enemies expecially againts United State in Vietnam war, Vietnamese soldier can not face them directly, instead they ambush the army from the bush or the forest and even the people who fought for america during this war have to admit that they were very scared when looking at any bush or trees because they dont know if they can speak vietnamese and shot AK-47
