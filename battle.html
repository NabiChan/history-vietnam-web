But the more we make concessions, the more the French colonialists encroach on us because they want to take over our country again. No! We are better off sacrificing everything than losing our country and becoming slaves. Those who have guns will use guns. Those who have swords will use swords. If [you] don't have swords, then use hoes, spades, sticks and canes. Everyone must try to fight against the French colonialists to save our country."<br>

                        The Second Period of the Indochina War (1951-1954) was the decisive phase of Vietnam's fight for independence. During this time, the Việt Minh, under the leadership of Hồ Chí Minh and General Võ Nguyên Giáp, transformed into a stronger, more organized army. Key battles such as Hòa Bình (1951-1952) and the Northwest Campaign (1952) demonstrated growing Vietnamese strength. The turning point came with the historic Điện Biên Phủ Campaign in 1954, where the Việt Minh defeated the French fortress after 56 days of fierce fighting. This victory led to the Geneva Accords in July 1954, which ended French colonial rule in Indochina and temporarily divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel, setting the stage for the later Vietnam War
