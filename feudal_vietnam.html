On 17 February 1859, they took citadel of Saigon within only 2 days and Nguyễn Tri Phương had to move to the south to fight the invaders.<br>

                            <br>
                            Many of the later movement and revolution was ended with lost due to lack of modern weapons and equipment to resit the French. Vietnamese people in this era have to face even more taxes and discrimination in this era, although the France made 2 modernization progress for the transportation and facilities but they was almost all only served for the transportation of armies and resources for France people. France also deploy assimilation policy made children to learn French at school and taught that they are French and only teach French history.<br>
                            <br>
                            Coming to the 1900s, there were 2 significant movements. One is Đông Du or "Travel to the East" led by Phan Bội Châu and his plan was to send Vietnamese people to Japan to learn more about technology, modernization and weapons so in the future they could come back to Vietnam to led a revolution for the independent of Vietnam. However, this was ultimately failed due to growing relationship between France and the Japanese, France make diplomatic pressure which make Japan have to deported Châu<br>

                    Another movement is Duy Tân Movement led by Phan Châu Trinh, favoring a peaceful movement by stressing the importance of education in modernizing, developing economies and fostering understanding and tolerence between French and Vietnamese. In 1907, he and associates Lương Văn Can, Nguyễn Quyền opened a patriotic modern school name Tonkin Free School in Hanoi and the purpose of it is to open the vietnamese people mind without taking money and they adapt the use of Romanized Quốc Ngữ alphabelt to quickly educated people.<br>
                    <br>
                    After the 2 movements failed or didn't gain much result, Vietnamese movement started to shift to the radical path. Phan Bội Châu create another movememnt name Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội in Guangzhou planning armed resistance against the French. Unfortanately in 1925, he was captured in Shanghai and was took to Vietnam to executed but Vietnamese people resistance for sparing Phan Bội Châu make him only placed under house arrét till he dead in 1940.

To avoid any conflicts and strengthen relationship between 3 parties, Nguyễn Ái Quốc (Hồ Chí Minh) was sent to Hongkong to unified the 3 parties into only 1 party named  Vietnamese Communist Party (CPV) with Trần Phú as the first Secretary General latered renamed to Indochinese Communist Party. The communist party led the rebelled Soviet Nghệ-Tĩnh in 1930-31 which was the peak of revolution and was an important step to the revolution in 1945 although the rebelled later failed<br>
